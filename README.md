## Features

- [x] Create, view, delete projects & tasks for the project
- [x] `Validate input data`; if it's invalid, show modal with info message
- [x] Display `fallback content` if no project is selected if there are no tasks for the project yet
- [x] Used `refs` to get data from inputs
- [x] Used `forwardRef`, `useImperativeHandle` to create a modal window and call it on other components
- [x] Used `createPortal` to move the modal window higher in the DOM tree for `better accessibility and semantics`

## Extra

- [x] Used `Context API` together with `useReducer()` for state management - logic could be found in [store](./src/store/) folder
- [x] `Date formatting` using `local` settings
- [x] Clean code with the use of `ESLint`, `Prettier` & `lint-staged`
- [x] Deploy on Netlify so you can [manage your business plans](https://project-management-by-marie.netlify.app/)
